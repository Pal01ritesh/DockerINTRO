Docker is a container platform that allows you to build, test and deploy applications quickly. A developer defines all the applications and itâ€™s dependencies in a Dockerfile which is then used to build Docker images that defines a Docker container. Doing this ensures that your application will run in any environment.



some commands of docker in general

docker ps -a  -> lists all the containers running in the docker
docker container prune -f  -> deletes all the stopped containers in the docker environment.
docker run hello-world   ->   first searches locally then if not found download and installs the image.

docker run -it ubuntu     ->      runs the ubuntu in interactive environment
docker ps    ->       gives the list of all the container that are currently running
docker images  -> gives the list of all the images installed in the docker.


if you want to add a bash shell to a container then copy the container id and run the command

command    ->     docker container exec it containerid bash




to run a container in background we have to use the detached mode

command   ->     docker run -d ubuntu



Remove an image

command   ->     docker rmi ubuntu -f



#remove all the images of the docker at once



docker rmi $(docker images -q) -f


# to list all the images in the docker with their image id only

docker images -q


#bulding your own image


 f docker build -t myimage .



# write this code in docker file


FROM ubuntu
CMD ["echo" , "hello there "]
